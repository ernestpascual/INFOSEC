    <h3>Save and Learn Mutual Funds!</h3>
    <p>There are several types of mutual funds under FAMI management, that  cater to different financial goals and risk appetites.   To decide what type of mutual fund you should invest in, you have to first decide what you will use the money for, and when you might need to use it,  and how much risk you are willing to take.</p>
    <div class="white-box">
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>SAVE & LEARN EQUITY FUND (SALEF) – This is an actively managed portfolio of selected stocks with strong balance sheets and attractive valuations.  Its goal is to provide growth through long-term capital appreciation.  It is an ideal investment for investors seeking high growth with high risk.</p>
